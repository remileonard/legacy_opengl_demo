                CYCLES - solo or multiplayer motorcycle game

                by Robin Humble, Alan Lipton and Nick Fitton




     SYNOPSIS
          cycles [ -i ifaddr ] [ -t ttl ]

     COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
          See also the TCP/IP User's Guide and mrouted(1M).

          -i ifaddr   select the outgoing interface address (if you
                      have multiple network interfaces)

          -t ttl      select the time to live of multicast packets
                      (default 1).




       You are riding your cycle against humans and hunter killer robots. 
       Avoid hitting all bike trails.  Points are awarded for excessive 
       speed and making others crash near you or run into your trail.
                   Really politically correct huh?
       Look for holes through to other levels, however only you can see 
       your holes ... and they move!




       note the use of the environment variable, CYCLESOUND, in cycles.sh.
       this must be correctly specified or you don't get to play.
