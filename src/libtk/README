                       Nano Window Toolkit library


  
      This library was created to help OpenGL Application writers who 
      suddenly find themselves without simple window support they found 
      in IrisGL.

      The library provides simple windowing functions (creating and 
      closing windows), event handling (keyboard and mouse events) via 
      callback functions and a few extra goodies (cursor control, 
      simple geometric shape creations, fonts, etc.).

      The library can also be used as a reference for those needing 
      sample code.  The routines found in the library can be integrated 
      into your application and expanded if found lacking.

      The complete API can be found in tk.h as well as defines, 
      enumerates and structure definitions.  Each functionality set in 
      the library is separated into files for easier understanding.

      The current library assumes the X windowing system.
